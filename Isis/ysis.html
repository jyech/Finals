          <p class="carousel-item__description">Ysis's father, Tyreon, may appear to be a stern and imposing figure when seen from the outside. 
            However, within the confines of their family circle, he reveals a heart of gold. 
            Despite his formidable exterior, Tyreon is exceedingly sweet and affectionate towards his loved ones. 
            He prioritizes their well-being and happiness, often going to great lengths to ensure their comfort and security. 
            This stark contrast between his public and private personas showcases the depth of his love and commitment to his family.
